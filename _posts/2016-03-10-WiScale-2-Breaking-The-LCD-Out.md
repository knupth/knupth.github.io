It's pretty empty in the scales. Just the battery, some wires going out to the weight sensors, the controller chip and the LCD. The LCD is connected to the board via a plastic ribbon cable. I cut off the back half of the attached ribbon cable with a sharp knife, leaving the back half of the solder pads exposed, then soldered my own wires on. That way I can still use the LCD while piggybacking the signal.

Using a 2032 coin battery I probed around to flesh out the pin connections. This one has 4 backplanes and 11 segment pins.
