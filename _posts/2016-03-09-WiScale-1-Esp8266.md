title: Wiscale Post 1: Esp8266
---

I started with the Esp8266 module code since logging to wifi is the main goal of the project.

Everything went surprisingly smoothly. I followed [THIS](http://www.arduinesp.com/getting-started) tutorial to "Hello world" it and [THIS](http://www.arduinesp.com/thingspeak) tutorial to hook it up to [thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

The only issue was that, as is mentioned on the thingspeak-Esp8266 page, that tutorial is a little updated. You don't need to include the newlines, returns or APIkey in postStr anymore.

I've hooked two indicator LEDs up to the Esp8266 too, one for "message sending" and another for "message sent". Seeing the "message sending" will tell me that the module has hooked up to both the wifi and arduino correctly, while "message sent" means that I'm done and can go about my day.
